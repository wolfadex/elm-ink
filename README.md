An Elm package (plus JS package) for writing apps for your terminal.

## Getting Started

- Inside your cloned repo, run `direnv allow`
- Run `npx elm-esm make src/Main.elm --output=dist/elm.js` to generate your compiled Elm
- Run `node dist/example.js` to view the demo
- Alter `src/Main.elm` to try out different things
